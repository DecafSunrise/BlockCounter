A coworker showed up with a wrist brace on one day. What's with the wrist brace? She had been building 
"base-10 block"-style visualizations manually, in Powerpoint... And got some sort of repetitve strain injury. 

This tool seeks to solve that problem: You can interactively generate and interate on visualizations to get 
the look right, then simply copy and paste it into your reporting software of choice (Word, Powerpoint, etc).
It even makes a legend for you!
